# NotGoogle

A search engine web application

* Created a web crawler that gathers words that could be used as search terms from the web and uses them and the websites they were found on to build an inverted index data structure.
* Implemented multithreading with Runnable tasks in order to improve the speed of performing searches on the inverted index
* Utilized a MySQL database to allow for user accounts
